## Steps recommended

bash train.sh A/B/C  # train only once, ABC are the same

bash test_no_tol.sh A/B/C

## Train

bash train.sh B  # for test B, models will be saved in ../train/models/

bash train.sh C  # for test C, but it is no need to train it again

## Predict

bash test.sh A/B/C  

bash test_no_tol.sh A/B/C

## Feature
block: range(0, 60 / 10 * 24)

stationID: range(0, 81)

status: range(0, 2)

payType: range(0, 4)

week: range(0, 7)

holiday: range(0, 2)

flow: number_in or number_out

yesterday: the flow of yesterday, has many differences to daily meanings

lastWeek: just the flow of (current day - 7)

averWeek: the mean of days before current day with the same week feature value

averWeekOutIn: similar to averWeek, but ignore pay type

yesterdayNormal: in daily meanings

## Models

In the first time, I try to use SAE showed in the References, but it is 
hard to train and spend much more time in training, and the time of 
this competition is short, so I finally choose fully connected 
networks, which I thought can have similarity performance to SAE.

The construction of features in the References is not suitable to this 
competition, due to the data sets has very large difference. 
The training data set of this competitions has very strong relation 
between weeks, but the test data don't have such a good pattern, so it 
will lead to over-fitting. 

Problems: there are many mistakes made by myself, many models' 
parameters are wrongly set, such as not set drop out, wrong n_outputs, 
wrong features to train, and wrong validate set. But due to the need of 
recurring the result of test B, these wrong settings are being kept.

All the models used in test B are base on the fully connected network 
with different parameters. The differences of each model will be list 
below:
